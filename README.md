# Co
A fork of RCO without the FPS Unlocker.
Mac only. You can still use on Windows by downloading ClientAppSettings.json and following some random youtuber's steps. As for Linux, good luck running roblox in general ;(

# Installation
Paste this into the command line;

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coolpeter98/Rco/main/install.sh | sh ```
